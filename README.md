# Picassolana: Pay-to-Earn Contest Game

## Introduction

Picassolana is an innovative Pay-to-Earn prompt-engineering game where creativity meets the blockchain. Each day, we publish an image, and contestants across the web and Telegram can compete by attempting to find a prompt that leads the closest to the published image. Contestants are scored from 0 to 100, and the best submission of the day wins an NFT generated exclusively for the occasion. With a leaderboard to track top performers and a shareable option to spread the word, Picassolana is not just a game â€“ it's a daily NFT challenge for the best at prompt engineering.
